# Underwater-Tunnel

My first Android Game made 4 years ago in openGL. These were my beginnings with java: no design patterns, no good practices, no clean code :). I've just bought a book and started coding !

All matrix operations are in Object class. It's wrapper for all low-level openGL functions.
